            <p class="lg-copy">KMC needed to validate its software before the worldwide launch of its new control system. KMC turned to ProMazo to complete the testing of their software over the course of several months. We were required to bring together a diverse team to ensure that both techinical and non-technical employees could understand how to implement the system in the field.</p>
