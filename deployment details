Promazo basic deployment details

ProMazo on test has been deployed on an EC2 instance using postgresql, static and media files all served from that
instance. It has also be deployed to run using nginx, Gunicorn and Supervisorctl. This is based on the deployment
on the current test server. For full deployment with S3 and RDS, new instructions will be required

Instructions on how this was done can be found at
